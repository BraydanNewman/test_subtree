# File Corrupter
### Corrupt any file you put in

Any file you wish to corrupt can be put into the folder called "files_to_corrupt".
If the folder does not exist it can ether be created by you or just run the application
and it will be automatically created 

Any file with "CORRUPTED_" at the start of its name has been corrupted, and it will not change the original file in anyway.

If you find you want the file more corrupt place the already corrupted file back in the folder and run the application again.

You can move the "corrupter.exe" file anywhere and is a standalon aplication.

This will be a major test
