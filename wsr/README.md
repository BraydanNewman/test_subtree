# Website Spammer/Reloader
This program just continuously reloads a web page and I used it at school 
to be the person with the most views on a class page and no, I have no 
use for it so I give it you.

Try not to increase the speed too much as this may cause you to get banned

## How To Use 
1. Run the python file called "lol.py"
2. In the terminal type in the URL of the website you want to reload quickly and click enter
3. It will then proceed to load the webpage in a Browser Window
    * __If the website needs a password this is where you enter those details__
4. Then in the terminal click enter to continue with the 'Spamming'
5. The number of requests will appear on the left side and the status will appear on 
the right
    * __The status number should be in the 200's and if it is not there is an issue__
## Problem Running
If there is an issue with the program, the problem may be the chrome driver,
as the chrome driver in the project is for Chrome Version 85. It will not work
with a different version of Chrome or a different browser.

If you have the driver issue you will need to find and download the
correct one online. Just make sure you name the new driver "driver.exe"

### Enjoy!
